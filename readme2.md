# ü™® `@benev/slate`

> üöß prerelease wip under constructon subject to change

- frontend ui framework
- built on [lit](https://lit.dev/)
- views and web components
- hooks syntax
- state management

<br/>

## üë∑ quick start

1. install slate
    ```sh
    npm i @benev/slate
    ```
1. prepare your app's frontend and context
    ```ts
    import {prepare_frontend, Context} from "@benev/slate"

    export const {carbon, oxygen, obsidian, quartz} = (
      prepare_frontend(new class extends Context {
        theme = css`
          * {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            box-sizing: border-box;
          }
        `
      })
    )
    ```
1. import html and css template functions
    ```ts
    import {html, css} from "@benev/slate"
    ```

<br/>

## ‚öôÔ∏è components

### define your components

this is how you create web components that are custom html elements.

they can be used in plain html `<my-oxygen></my-oxygen>`.

1. **oxygen** ‚Äî light-dom element
    ```ts
    export const MyOxygen = oxygen(use => {
      const count = use.signal(0)
      const increment = () => count.value++

      return html`
        <span>${count}</span>
        <button @click=${increment}>increment</button>
      `
    })
    ```
1. **carbon** ‚Äî shadow-dom element
    ```ts
    const styles = css`span {color: yellow}`

    export const MyCarbon = carbon({styles}, use => {
      const count = use.signal(0)
      const increment = () => count.value++

      return html`
        <span>${count}</span>
        <button @click=${increment}>increment</button>
      `
    })
    ```

### register and use your components

1. register your components to the dom
    ```ts
    import {register_to_dom} from "@benev/slate"

    register_to_dom({
      MyOxygen,
      MyCarbon,
    })
    ```
    - the component names are automatically converted from `CamelCase` to `kebab-case`
1. use your components in any html on the page
    ```html
    <section>
      <my-oxygen></my-oxygen>
      <my-carbon></my-carbon>
    </section>
    ```

<br/>

## üñºÔ∏è views

### define your views

views are like components, but they are not custom html elements.

what's great about them, is that they are javascript functions which are imported and injected into the html templates for other views or components -- and as javascript functions, your IDE can rename them across the codebase, and find-all-references, and you get full typescript typings for their props (whereas html-based web components do not afford you the same luxuries).

views accept js parameters called `props`.

1. **quartz** ‚Äî light-dom view
    ```ts
    export const MyQuartz = quartz(use => (start: number) => {
      const count = use.signal(start)
      const increment = () => count.value++

      return html`
        <span>${count}</span>
        <button @click=${increment}>increment</button>
      `
    })
    ```
1. **obsidian** ‚Äî shadow-dom view
    ```ts
    const styles = css`span {color: yellow}`

    export const MyObsidian = obsidian({styles}, use => (start: number) => {
      const count = use.signal(start)
      const increment = () => count.value++

      return html`
        <span>${count}</span>
        <button @click=${increment}>increment</button>
      `
    })
    ```
    - `auto_exportparts` is enabled by default:
      - auto exportparts is an awesome feature that makes it bearable to use the shadow dom extensively.
      - if auto_exportparts is enabled, and you provide the view a `part` attribute, then it will automatically re-export all internal parts, using the part as a prefix
      - thus, parts can bubble up, each shadow boundary adds a new hyphenated prefix, so you can do css like `::part(search-input-icon)`

### using your views

1. import your views
    ```ts
    import {MyQuartz} from "./my-quartz.js"
    import {MyObsidian} from "./my-obsidian.js"
    ```
1. inject your quartz views into any html template like this
    ```ts
    html`
      <aside>
        ${MyQuartz(123)}
      </aside>
    `
    ```
    - quartz views are beautifully simple
    - without any shadow-dom, they have no stylesheet, and without a wrapping element, they have no attributes
1. inject your obsidian views like this
    ```ts
    html`
      <aside>
        ${MyObsidian([123])}
      </aside>
    `
    ```
    - your obsidian views need their props wrapped in an array
1. obsidian views will accept a settings object
    ```ts
    html`
      <aside>
        ${MyObsidian([123], {
          auto_exportparts: true,
          attrs: {
            part: "cool",
            "data-whatever": true,
          },
          content: html`
            <p>slotted content</p>
          `,
        })}
      </aside>
    `
    ```
    - obsidian views are wrapped in a `<obsidian-view>` component
    - this is where the shadow root is attached
    - in the settings object, you can pass attributes, slotted content, etc
    - this is why obsidian views are more complex than their simpler counterparts, quartz views

<br/>

## ü™ù `use` hooks

### universal hooks for all views and components

- **use.state**  
    works like react useState hook
    ```ts
    const [count, setCount] = use.state(0)
    const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
    ```
- **use.signal**  
    create a reactive container for a value *(inspired by [preact signals](https://preactjs.com/blog/introducing-signals/))*
    ```ts
    const count = use.signal(0)
    const increment = () => count.value++
    ```
    you can directly inject the whole signal into html
    ```ts
    html`<span>${count}</span>`
    ```
- **use.op**  
    create an OpSignal in a loading/error/ready state, and can hold a result value
    ```ts
    const count = use.op()
    count.run(async() => fetchCount("/count"))
    ```
    you can directly inject the whole signal into html
    ```ts
    html`<span>${count}</span>`
    ```
- **use.flatstate**  
    create a reactive object *(inspired by [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) and [snapstate](https://github.com/chase-moskal/snapstate))*
    ```ts
    const state = use.flatstate({count: 0})
    const increment = () => state.count++
    ```
- **use.setup**  
    perform setup/cleanup on dom connected/disconnected
    ```ts
    use.setup(() => {
      const interval = setInterval(increment, 1000)
      return () => clearInterval(interval)
    })
    ```
- **use.prepare**  
    initialize a value once
    ```ts
    const random_number = use.prepare(() => Math.random())
    ```
- **use.context**  
    access to your app's context, for whatever reason
    ```ts
    await use.context.flat.wait
    ```
    by default, context has `theme`, `signals`, and `flat`, but you specify your own context in `prepare_frontend`, so you can put any app-level state in there that you might want

### special `use` access

- **use.element** *~ carbon, oxygen, obsidian ~*  
    access the underlying html element
    ```ts
    use.element.querySelector("p")
    ```
- **use.shadow** *~ carbon, obsidian ~*  
    access to the shadow root
    ```ts
    use.shadow.querySelector("slot")
    ```
- **use.attrs** *~ carbon, oxygen ~*  
    declare accessors for html attributes
    ```ts
    const attrs = use.attrs({
      start: Number,
      label: String,
      ["data-active"]: Boolean,
    })
    ```
    set them like normal js properties
    ```ts
    attrs.start = 123
    attrs.label = "hello"
    attrs["data-active"] = true
    ```
    get them like normal js properties
    ```ts
    console.log(attrs.start) // 123
    console.log(attrs.label) // "hello"
    console.log(attrs["data-active"]) // true
    ```
    components rerender when any attributes change from outside

## üîÆ advanced stuff

### gold and silver elements

- non-hooks class-based LitElement-alternative components
- `GoldElement` is a shadow-dom component base class
- `SilverElement` is a light-dom component base class
- these are used as primitives underlying carbon/oxygen components
- they do not have context, theme, or any state management reactivity applied
  - you can apply those with the mixins found by importing `mixins`
  - you can use `Attributes.base(this as BaseElement)` to create attribute accessors

### `prepare_frontend` vs `deferred_frontend`

- `prepare_frontend` "bakes" your app context into the component and view functions at import-time, "before" your components and views are defined. this makes your developer experience simple and pleasant.
- however, if you want to make the theme css customizable (maybe you're authoring a library), or if you need to accept the context object *later* for some reason, this can create a bit of an awkward chicken-vs-egg timing situation.
- `deferred_frontend` is an alternative designed to solve this problem by deferring the passing of context to each individual component and view.
- deferred makes your experience more cumbersome, because you have to pass the context into every view before you can use them. deferred_frontend gives you a `provide` function which makes it easy to pass context to a group of views for that purpose.

## ü•û flatstate

flatstate help you create state objects and react when properties change.

flatstate is inspired by mobx and snapstate, but designed to be super simple: flatstate only works on *flat* state objects, only the direct properties of state objects are tracked for reactivity.

### flatstate basics

- create a flatstate tracking context
  ```ts
  import {Flat} from "@benev/slate"

  const flat = new Flat()
    // what happens in this flat, stays in this flat.
    // you probably only want one for your whole app.
  ```
- make a flat state object
  ```ts
  const state = flat.state({count: 0})
  ```
- setup a reaction
  ```ts
  flat.reaction(() => console.log(state.count))
    //-> 0

  state.count++
    //-> 1
  ```
  - flatstate records which state properties your reaction reads
  - flatstate calls your reaction whenever those specific properties change
  - your reaction can listen to more than one state object

### flatstate details

- reactions are debounced -- so you may have to wait to see state changes
  ```ts
  const flat = new Flat()
  const state = flat.state({amount: 100})

  state.amount = 101
  console.log(state.amount) //-> 100 (old value)

  await flat.wait
  console.log(state.amount) //-> 101 (now it's ready)
  ```
- you can stop a reaction
  ```ts
  const stop = flat.reaction(() => console.log(state.count))

  stop() // end this particular reaction
  ```
- clear all reactions on a flatstate instance
  ```ts
  // clear all reactions on this flat instance
  flat.clear()
  ```

### flatstate reactions

- so first, there's a simple one-function reaction:
  ```ts
  flat.reaction(() => console.log(state.count))
  ```
  - flatstate immediately runs the function, and records which properties it reads
  - then, anytime one of those properties changes, it runs your function again
- you can also do a two-function reaction:
  ```ts
  flat.reaction(
    () => ({count: state.count}),
    ({count}) => console.log(count),
  )
  ```
  - now there's a separation between your "collector" and your "responder"
  - the collector "passes" relevant data to the responder function
  - flatstate calls the responder whenever that data changes
- there's also this helper called "collectivize" if you prefer this syntax:
  ```ts
  const c = Flat.collectivize(state)

  flat.reaction(
    c(({count}) => ({count})),
    ({count}) => console.log(count)
  )
  ```
- there's also something called "deepReaction"
  ```ts
  flat.deepReaction(() => console.log(state.count))
  ```
  - it's the same as "reaction", but it has "discovery" enabled
  - discovery means the collector is checked again for every responder call
  - it's less efficient, but allows you to respond to deeply nested recursive structures
- there's also `.auto` and `.manual` reactions
  - these allow you to set options like `discovery` and `debounce` (you can turn off the debouncer)
  - but that's bigbrain stuff that you'll have to read the sourcecode about

### flatstate advanced

- multiple flatstate instances are totally isolated from each other
  ```ts
  const flat1 = new Flat()
  const flat2 = new Flat()
  ```
- create readonly access to a state object
  ```ts
  const state = flat.state({count: 0})
  const rstate = Flat.readonly(state)

  state.count = 1
  await flat.wait
  console.log(rstate.count) //-> 1

  rstate.count = 2 // !! ReadonlyError !!
  ```
  - btw, you can use readonly on anything, not just flatstate

### flatstate integration with frontend elements

- let your components rerender on flat state changes
  ```ts
  import {apply} from "@benev/slate"

  const MyElement2 = mixin.flat(flat)(MyElement)
    // can also be a class decorator

  const elements2 = apply.flat(flat)(elements)
  ```
  - this works on any BaseElement, which includes LitElement, GoldElement, SilverElement, carbon, and oxygen

## ü™à pipe

- pipe data through a series of functions
- maybe you've done silly nesting like this:
  ```ts
  // bad
  register_to_dom(
    apply.signals(signals)(
      apply.flat(flat)(
        apply.css(theme)(
          requirement.provide(context)(elements)
        )
      )
    )
  )
  ```
- now you can do this instead:
  ```ts
  import {Pipe} from "@benev/slate"

  // good
  Pipe.with(elements)
    .to(requirement.provide(context))
    .to(apply.css(theme))
    .to(apply.flat(flat))
    .to(apply.signals(signals))
    .to(register_to_dom)
  ```

<br/>
<br/>

## üí´ op

utility for ui loading/error/ready states.

useful for implementing async operations that involve loading indicators.

- create some ops
  ```ts
  import {Op} from "@benev/slate"

  Op.loading()
    //= {mode: "loading"}

  Op.error("a fail occurred")
    //= {mode: "error", reason: "a fail occurred"}

  Op.ready(123)
    //= {mode: "ready", payload: 123}
  ```
- you can run an async operation and keep things synchronized
  ```ts
  let my_op = Op.loading()

  await Op.run(op => my_op = op, async() => {
    await nap(1000)
    return 123
  })
  ```
- you can create op signals that have op functionality built in
  ```ts
  const count = use.op()

  count.run(async() => {
    await sleep(1000)
    return 123
  })
  ```
- functions to interrogate an op
  ```ts
    //        type for op in any mode
    //                 v
  function example(op: Op.Any<number>) {

    // branching based on the op's mode
    Op.select(op, {
      loading: () => console.log("op is loading"),
      error: reason => console.log("op is error", reason),
      ready: payload => console.log("op is ready", payload)
    })

    const payload = Op.payload(op)
      // if the mode=ready, return the payload
      // otherwise, return undefined
  }
  ```
