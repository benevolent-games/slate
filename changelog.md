- 游꼞 *harmlesss -- addition, fix, or enhancement*

<br/>

--------------------------------

<br/>

## v0.2

### v0.2.6

- 游댰 tweak generic type signature on `Pool`
- 游꼞 add: tool `concurrent`

### v0.2.5

- 游댰 ts target `es2023`, seems all evergreen browsers support it
- 游댰 deprecated `maptool` in favor of `Map2`
- 游꼞 add: tool `requestAnimationFrameLoop`
- 游꼞 add: tool `Map2` facility will replace maptool

### v0.2.2

- 游꼞 add `use.deferOnce`
- 游댰 deprecated `is.void(x)`, renamed to `is.unavailable(x)`
- 游댰 deprecated `is.defined(x)`, renamed to `is.available(x)`

### v0.2.0

- 游린 ***camel case!***
  - `light_view` is now `lightView`
  - `light_component` is now `lightComponent`
  - `shadow_view` is now `shadowView`
  - `shadow_component` is now `shadowComponent`
- 游린 `use.defer`
  - now returns a `Signal`
  - it used to directly return a value
  - the reason for this change, was that the old way created a footgun where it's very easy to accidentally hold an old reference to the deferred value that you wanted. so, now using a signal, your access to the signal's value is more likely to be an up-to-date reference
- op loading effects
  - 游린 `prep_op_effect` replaced by `makeLoadingEffect` or `makeAnimatedLoadingEffect`
  - 游꼞 added `loading` effects like `loading.binary(op, onReady)` and `loading.braille(op, onReady)`
- 游린 eliminated `@benev/slate/x/pure.js`
  - beware if you are using slate in a node.js environment
  - `pure.js` was an alternative entrypoint for node to import the parts of slate that didn't touch any DOM apis
  - instead, now, if you are importing slate into node, you should do this first:
      ```ts
      import "@benev/slate/x/node.js"
      ```
  - all this does is assign `global.HTMLElement = class {}` because extending HTMLElement is the only contact that slate has with the dom at import time
  - thus, the new `node.js` is a little shim that lets you import all of slate in node (maybe for unit testing or to use some tools)
- 游린 `interval` tool: changed arguments
  - now it accepts plain milliseconds
  - whereas the new `interval.hz` accepts hertz, replacing what used to be called `interval`
  - thus, to upgrade, replace `interval(1, fn)` with `interval.hz(1, fn)`
- 游댰 deprecate `signal.subscribe` in favor of `signal.on`
- 游댰 deprecate tools:
  - `Trashcan` (in favor of `Trashbin`)
  - `pub` (in favor of `pubsub`)
- 游꼞 added `use.load` helper for creating an op and immediately initiating a load operation
- 游꼞 added tools:
  - `wherefor`
  - `ref` and `Ref`

<br/>

## v0.1

### v0.1.2

- 游댰 added `watch.wait` promise, because watch tower dispatches are now debounced

### v0.1.1

- 游댰 rename `FancyEventListener` to `LitListener`
- 游꼞 add: tools `ev`, `Trashcan`, `litListener`, and `pubsub`
- 游꼞 views now expect a relaxed template type, `RenderResult`, which means views can return other views and strings etc

### v0.1.0

nexus rewrite
- 游린 `Slate` renamed to `Nexus`
- 游린 silly names have been purged
  - renamed `ObsidianRenderer` to `ShadowViewRenderer`
  - renamed `CarbonRenderer` to `ShadowComponentRenderer`
  - renamed `QuartzRenderer` to `LightViewRenderer`
  - renamed `OxygenRenderer` to `LightComponentRenderer`
  - tons of renames following the same pattern have occurred

shadow views and components
- 游린 simpler syntax: remove settings array, in favor of new hooks
  - old way
    ```ts
    slate.shadow_view({name: "coolview", styles}, use => () => {
      return html`hi`
    })
    ```
  - new way
    ```ts
    slate.shadow_view(use => () => {
      use.name("coolview")
      use.styles(styles)

      return html`hi`
    })
    ```

use
- 游린 `use.setup` renamed to `use.mount`
- 游린 `use.prepare` renamed to `use.once`
- 游린 renamed various types and helpers
  - types
    - `SetupFn` to `Mount`
    - `Setdown` to `Unmount`
    - `InitFn` to `Init`
  - helpers
    - `setupFn` to `mountFn`
- 游꼞 add hook `use.effect(fn, dependencies)` (all views and components)
- 游꼞 add hook `use.defer(fn)` (all views and components)
- 游꼞 add hook `use.name(name)` (all views)
- 游꼞 add hook `use.styles(styles)` (shadow_view and shadow_component)

views
- 游린 `<obsidian-view>` renamed to `<slate-view>`
- 游린 light_view (quartz) contents are now wrapped in `<slate-view>`
  - this is to provide an anchor point from which the view can query its own contents
  - this also helps light_view behavior match shadow_view

ops (and OpSignal)
- 游린 rename `Op.run` to `Op.load`
  - also rename `OpSignal->run` to `OpSignal->load`
- 游린 `Op.load` and `OpSignal->load` now throws errors
  - it still sets the op to an error state
  - but now it also throws an error, so you can catch it directly
- 游린 rename op 'mode' to 'status'
  - change `Op.Mode` to `Op.Status`
  - change `op.mode` to `op.status` on your op objects
- 游린 rework OpSignal checkers, from getters to functions
  - change `op.loading` to `op.isLoading()`
  - change `op.error` to `op.isError()`
  - change `op.ready` to `op.isReady()`
  - this was necessary for the new form to be proper ts type guards
- 游꼞 fix checkers like `Op.is.loading` to have proper ts type guards
- 游꼞 fix signals.op return type to be OpSignal

tools
- 游린 rename `MapSubset` type to `MapBase`
- 游린 rename `maptool(map).grab(..)` to `maptool(map).guarantee(..)`
- 游꼞 export `mapGuarantee(map, k, v)` function, technically more efficient than `maptool(map).guarantee(k, v)`
- 游린 rework `ob` tool syntax
  - `ob.map(object, transform)` becomes `ob(object).map(transform)`
  - `ob.filter(object, predicate)` becomes `ob(object).filter(predicate)`
- 游린 recapitulated `deepEqual` and `deepFreeze` into new `deep` tool
  - `deepEqual` becomes `deep.equal`
  - `deepFreeze` becomes `deep.freeze`
  - both functions have been reworked to handle maps and sets
- 游꼞 add `is` tool
  - proper typescript type guard support
  - `is.object(x)`
  - `is.array(x)`
  - `is.defined(x)`

watch
- 游린 `watch.track` now returns an unsubscribe function, instead of the collector's data
  - if you need the data from your collector, just run the collector yourself
- 游꼞 add `Historian` and `AppCore` for creating apps with undo/redo capabilities

<br/>

## v0.0

### v0.0.0

in this recent work, the `flat` and `signals` state management apis are converging.

- 游린 removed synonyms `slate.carbon`, `slate.oxygen`, `slate.obsidian`, `slate.quartz`
  - now you should use `slate.shadow_component`, `slate.light_component`, `slate.shadow_view`, `slate.shadow_component` respectively
- 游린 `flat` breaking changes
  - removed `.manual`, `.auto`, `.deepReaction`
  - flat now implements `ReactorCore`
    - `.reaction` always has debouncing and discovery enabled
    - `.wait` to wait for the debouncer to fire responders
    - `.lean` for advanced integrations
- 游린 `signals` breaking changes
  - removed `.track` (now you should use `.reaction` instead)
  - signals now implements `ReactorCore`
    - `.reaction` always has debouncing and discovery enabled
    - `.wait` to wait for the debouncer to fire responders
    - `.lean` for advanced integrations
- 游댰 the way reactivity works has been rewritten, so be wary of new bugs
  - the flatstate and signals mixins have been rewritten using the new `.lean` methods
  - the internal `setup_reactivity` for slate components and views has been rewritten using the reactor's `.lean`
- 游꼞 added new state management system called `reactor`
  - implements `ReactorCore` (has `.reaction`, `.wait`, and `.lean`)
  - reactor *combines* both flatstate and signals reactivity
  - so you can make reactions that listen to both flatstates and signals
  - see usage examples in the readme
- 游꼞 added new `mixin.reactor` and `apply.reactor`
  - this is how you can mixin `reactor` support for your own elements, thus adding reactivity for both flatstate and signals at once
- note, there are no changes to `watch`
  - `watch` is fundamentally different than flatstate and signals, and is not suitable to become a ReactorCore
  - watch does not have any "automated" reactivity, it's always explicit, so it has `.track` instead of `.reaction`

  ```ts
  // old
  const slate = setup(context)
